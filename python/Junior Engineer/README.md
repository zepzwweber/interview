# Junior Engineer Task

## Task Overview
As a Junior Engineer, your task is to develop a simple Python script that processes a list of data and outputs the results. This task is designed to evaluate your understanding of basic Python syntax, control structures, and your ability to write clean, readable code.

## Objectives
1. **Data Processing**: You will be given a list of integers. Your script should perform the following operations:
   - Calculate the sum of the integers.
   - Calculate the average of the integers.
   - Identify the maximum and minimum values in the list.

2. **Output**: The results of your calculations should be printed in a clear and formatted manner.

## Expected Outcome
By completing this task, you should demonstrate:
- Proficiency in basic Python programming concepts.
- Ability to use control structures such as loops and conditionals.
- Capability to write clean and maintainable code.
- Understanding of basic data types and operations in Python.

## Example Input and Output
### Input
```python
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

### Output
```
Sum: 150
Average: 30.0
Maximum: 50
Minimum: 10
```

## Submission Guidelines
- Please submit your Python script as `data_processor.py`.
- Ensure your code is well-commented to explain your logic.
- Include a README file that describes how to run your script and any assumptions you made during development.
