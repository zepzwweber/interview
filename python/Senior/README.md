# Senior Engineer Task: Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview
As a Senior Engineer, you are tasked with designing and implementing a data processing pipeline using Python. This pipeline should efficiently handle large datasets and perform complex data manipulations. You will be expected to utilize libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to achieve this.

## Objectives
1. **Data Ingestion**: Create a mechanism to read data from various sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, databases).
2. **Data Cleaning**: Implement functions to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
3. **Data Transformation**: Use Pandas and NumPy to perform transformations such as aggregations, filtering, and reshaping the data.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the pipeline for performance, ensuring it can handle large datasets efficiently.
5. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for your code, including usage instructions and explanations of your design choices.

## Expected Outcome
- A well-structured Python project that includes:
  - A main script to execute the data processing pipeline.
  - Modular functions for each step of the pipeline (ingestion, cleaning, transformation).
  - Unit tests to validate the functionality of your code.
  - Documentation that explains how to run the pipeline and the rationale behind your design decisions.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Code Quality**: Clarity, readability, and adherence to Python best practices.
- **Functionality**: The pipeline should work as intended and handle edge cases gracefully.
- **Performance**: The solution should demonstrate efficiency in processing large datasets.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and clear documentation that aids in understanding the project.

This task is designed to evaluate your ability to design and implement complex data processing solutions in Python, showcasing your technical skills and problem-solving abilities.
