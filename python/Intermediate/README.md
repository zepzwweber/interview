# Intermediate Python Engineer Task

## Task Overview
As an Intermediate Python Engineer, your task is to build a web application using the Flask framework that interacts with a database. This application should allow users to perform basic operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

## Objectives
1. **Set Up Flask Application**: Create a new Flask application with the necessary project structure.
2. **Database Integration**: Use SQLAlchemy to connect to a relational database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) and perform CRUD operations.
3. **RESTful API Design**: Implement RESTful endpoints for managing records in the database.
4. **Data Validation**: Ensure that the data being processed is validated before being stored in the database.
5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.

## Expected Outcome
- A fully functional Flask web application that allows users to manage records in a database.
- Demonstration of understanding of web frameworks, RESTful principles, and database operations.
- Clean, maintainable code with appropriate documentation and comments.
- A suite of unit tests that cover the main functionalities of the application.

## Deliverables
- Source code of the Flask application.
- A README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.
- Unit tests that validate the functionality of the application.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and adherence to best practices.
- Completeness of the application and its features.
- Clarity and organization of the documentation.
- Effectiveness of the unit tests in covering the application logic.
