# Intermediate Engineer Task

## Task Overview
As an Intermediate Engineer, your task is to build a Java application that reads a CSV file containing employee records, processes the data, and outputs a summary report. This task evaluates your ability to work with file I/O, data structures, and modular code.

## Objectives
1. **File Reading**: Read a CSV file named `employees.csv` with columns: `id`, `name`, `department`, `salary`.
2. **Data Processing**:
   - Count the total number of employees.
   - Calculate the average salary.
   - List all employees in the "Engineering" department.
3. **Output**: Print the summary report in a clear, formatted manner to the console.

## Expected Outcome
- Proficiency with Java file I/O operations.
- Ability to parse and process CSV data.
- Use of classes, methods, and modular code structure.
- Clean, maintainable, and well-commented code.

## Example Input (`employees.csv`)
```
id,name,department,salary
1,Alice,Engineering,90000
2,Bob,HR,60000
3,Carol,Engineering,95000
```

## Example Output
```
Total employees: 3
Average salary: 81666.67
Engineering employees: Alice, Carol
```

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your code as `EmployeeReport.java`.
- Include a sample `employees.csv` file.
- Add a README explaining how to compile and run your program and any assumptions made.
